## Starting the App
1) Clone the git repo to your local machine.
2) Run NPM install.
3) Run npm start to run the app in dev mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Notes
- React app setup was bootstrapped via Create React App. There are files here (like registerServiceWorker.js) that are specific to that and not my work.

- The 'like' feature works asynchronously, hence the 'loading' spinner.

- I left console.logs in the code so that Jesse can see product 'likes' being incremented and decremented on the state.
